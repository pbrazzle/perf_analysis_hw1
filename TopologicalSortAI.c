*   C implementation of Kahn's algorithm
*   Written by ChatGPT-4o mini
*
*   --- Prompt: Please provide a C implementation to find a topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph
*
*   --- ChatGPT Output:
*
*   Certainly! 
*   To find a topological ordering of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in C, you can use Kahn's Algorithm or Depth-First Search (DFS) based algorithm. 
*   Below is a C implementation using Kahn's Algorithm, which is often simpler to understand and implement. 
*   Kahn's Algorithm uses an in-degree array to keep track of the number of incoming edges to each vertex and a queue to process vertices with zero in-degree.
*
*   Here's a complete C implementation for finding a topological ordering using Kahn's Algorithm:
*
*   [code]
*
*   Explanation:
*
*   1. Graph Representation: The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix `adjMatrix`, where `adjMatrix[i][j]` is `1` if there's an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.
*   2. In-Degree Calculation: Calculate the in-degrees for each vertex. The in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges directed towards it.
*   3. Queue Initialization: Enqueue all vertices with in-degree of 0 (no incoming edges).
*   4. Process Queue: Dequeue a vertex, print it, and reduce the in-degrees of its adjacent vertices. Enqueue any adjacent vertex that now has an in-degree of 0.
*   5. Cycle Detection: If the number of vertices processed is less than the total number of vertices, a cycle exists in the graph.
*
*   This implementation assumes that the graph has a maximum of 100 vertices. 
*   Adjust `MAX_VERTICES` as needed for larger graphs. 
*   The graph should be a DAG for the topological sort to be valid; otherwise, the algorithm will detect the cycle.
